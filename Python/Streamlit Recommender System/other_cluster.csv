A deeply disturbing pattern of psychological manipulation and sexual grooming begins to emerge.Higgins was the subject of a police investigation in the early 1990s, but the subsequent trial resulted in acquittal. Barry Bennell was first convicted in Florida in 1995. He and Higgins were the subject of a Dispatches documentary back in 1997, for which Dean Radford and Ian Ackley bravely waived their anonymity in order to discuss what had happened to them then. And yet the response to the Dispatches programme was deafening silence. How was it that, after such public scrutiny, the true scale of the offending was able to remain hidden? Back in the present day, a new investigation into Higgins comes to a head. Dean hopes and prays that, 30 years on, history won’t repeat itself."

Much more accessible than any other motorsport, stock car racing is raw and unfiltered. Competitors don't race stock cars to be rich or famous, they race to win.Cowdenbeath Racewall has long been regarded as one of the fastest and most feared tracks in the UK. With the final race weekend of the season approaching, it is the last chance for Scotland's best drivers to show they have what it takes, and they are going to give it everything they have. Both on and off the track, drivers dedicate a huge amount of time and energy looking for an elusive podium finish - but who will finish the season on a high?The stock car racing community is small, and rivalries run deep between drivers, families and fans. This is epitomised by Scotland's two most successful drivers - Chris Burgoyne and Gordon Moodie. Gordon and Chris have been racing against each other for more than 20 years, and the desire to win is only getting stronger.Gordon holds the record for the most wins in the Brisca Formula 2 category. He is extremely focused and dedicated to the sport he loves, going above and beyond to finish first, even going as far as starving himself to make his car lighter and give himself a competitive edge. However, due to illness, Gordon has been absent for much of the season, causing him to fall behind his main rival, Chris Burgoyne.Current world champion Chris is a family man and comes from an incredibly successful racing dynasty. The Burgoynes have competed and won across many different stock car formulas, and now the pressure to carry on that legacy falls on his shoulders. This year has seen Chris win the World Championship for the second time in his career, but now Gordon is back to full health and, with the final race of the season coming up, he has everything to lose.Unlike most motorsports, stock car racing sees men and women compete together, and for 17-year-old Taylor Borthwick this is a big year. After dominating in her junior formula, Taylor is now old enough to be racing against the adults. With her last race imminent, will she be able to establish herself in this competitive new field?"

Having finished fourth and then second to United, he and manager Kenny Dalglish are determined to go one better. With a personal fortune of £360 million, he has the money and the appetite to spend his way to success. After buying Alan Shearer for a British transfer record, he goes one better and smashes it again by signing Chris Sutton for £5m. But the rapid injection of money into the game – players’ salaries are hitting £10,000 a week - is starting to create a ‘them and us’ divide with the fans.The David and Goliath title race between Blackburn and United is too close to call until one cold January night halfway through the season, when Eric Cantona launches himself into the terraces of Selhurst Park and kung-fu kicks a Crystal Palace supporter who’s verbally abused him. It’s reported Cantona has been provoked by a racist slur, but his actions cause national outrage, and the threat of a prison term looms for the mercurial Frenchman.Despite the repackaging of football and the fanfare of the new Premier League, the sinister underbelly of racism remains."

The number 10 in rugby is arguably the most important player on the pitch. They are the master tactician and the playmaker, the goal kicker and the person who calls the shots. The number 10 shirt carries responsibility, respect and a sense of prestige and the pressure is intense both on and off the pitch. It’s the Irish fascination with the selection of who should wear the number 10 shirt which has produced great debate across the decades and created some of the most intense rivalries in world sport, such as that between Ollie Campbell and Tony Ward or Ronan O’Gara and David Humphreys. As the shirt is passed from one player to another and one generation to the next, we explore some of Ireland’s best ever number 10s, examine why the iconic shirt is so important and reflect on many of the most memorable moments in Irish rugby history.

Having unexpectedly come fourth in Beijing, to do even better at London meant defeating one of the three ‘untouchable’ sporting superpowers: the USA, China and Russia. The athletes would have to put in the performances of their lives.  To boost our chances, the Sporting Giants programme sought to expand our pool of potential medal winners by turning amateurs into elite competitors. Helen Glover was plucked from teacher training and given a shot at Olympic rowing glory. At the same time, the Mission 2012 tracking system monitored sports’ progress towards inescapable medal targets. With so much money on the line, the scrutiny seemed prudent, but at what cost to the athletes who struggled under the immense pressure?  With the eyes of the world on London, 2012 would be a milestone year for the Paralympics – an opportunity to transform the perception of Paralympians as elite athletes and to demonstrate how far the movement had come since the empty stands at Atlanta 16 years earlier.  Featuring interviews with Victoria Pendleton, Sir Chris Hoy, Sir Mo Farah, Dame Jessica Ennis-Hill, Helen Glover, Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, Nicola Adams and Ellie Simmonds, as well as former prime minister David Cameron, this film tells the story of the lengths we went to in search of Olympic glory, and the costs – paid in personal sacrifice – that made the gold rush possible."

On one side were Barry Hearn’s ‘Matchroom Mob’, including Dennis Taylor and Steve Davis: clean-living, utterly professional and family friendly. In sharp contrast was a group that included Alex Higgins, Jimmy White and Kirk Stevens, who all embraced a more rock-and-roll lifestyle.With Higgins’s career quickly spiralling out of control, Jimmy White was next in line to take the crown of ‘people’s champion’. But Jimmy also had an insatiable appetite for the highlife and a string of vices – including cocaine and crack - that threatened to overshadow his raw talent and enormous potential.Twelve years younger than Alex, Jimmy soon realised that Alex’s popularity and ability was at odds with his success in the game, having won only two world championship trophies in a sport many thought he should dominate. Indeed, Steve Davis had quickly become the world number one through practice and discipline and had suddenly become the man to beat. Desperate for success and tempted by the lucrative rewards brought by towing the line, Jimmy joined Barry Hearn in the hope he could be turned into a champion like his new stablemate, Steve Davis.Jimmy began the 90s clean and well-prepared and got his best opportunity yet to win his first world championship, coming up against a young emerging Scotsman called Stephen Hendry. With White as the hot favourite and with the crowd urging him on, the 1990 final turned out to be a pivotal moment in British snooker and paved the way for what was to come in the next decade."
